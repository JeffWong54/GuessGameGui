# GuessGameGui
a number is picked at random between 1 and 25. the user is tasked with guessing that number, every time they guess the tries counter goes up and the game tells the user if they are correct, to high, or to low. they have 5 tries to get the number correct. this is all done using a JavaFx GUI

  to complete this project I learned how to use SceneBuilder as well as how to correctly implement an action listene. When implementing the ActionEvent I used a try catch block with a custom exception. i did this to inform the user if they put in a number that is out of range (1 - 25). to do this I made a OutOFRangeException class that extends Exception.
